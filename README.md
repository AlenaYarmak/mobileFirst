# Educational project


This project was made solely for practice and layout demonstration.
Quite interesting and convenient technologies were used in the project:

- The Flexbox Layout
- Sass preprocessor
- Gulp
- 'mobile first'
- cross-browser compatibility
- responsive design with @media queries

The site uses interactive elements on hover.
